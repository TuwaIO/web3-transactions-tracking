## Feature & Synergy Analysis

The table below outlines the core features of each library, focusing on transaction tracking capabilities and key advantages. It also provides recommendations on how `web3-transactions-tracking` can be integrated with them.

| Library | Transaction Tracking | Transaction Pool | Key Advantages | Integration Synergy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[web3-transactions-tracking](https://github.com/tuwaio/web3-transactions-tracking)** | ✔️ **Yes.** Provides a complete transaction lifecycle tracking system (pending, success, failed, replaced). Supports standard EVM, Gelato, and Safe transactions. | ✔️ **Yes.** Manages a transaction pool using a Zustand store for centralized state management. | **Comprehensive Solution:** Offers both the core logic for tracking and ready-to-use UI components (notifications, modals).<br>**Extensible:** Built to support various transaction types.<br>**Centralized State:** Utilizes Zustand for predictable and easy-to-manage state. | N/A |
| **[Dynamic.xyz](https://www.dynamic.xyz/)** | ❌ **No.** The library does not explicitly provide transaction tracking features. | ❌ **No.** No information available on transaction pool management. | **Authentication & Authorization:** Strong focus on user identity, wallet connections, and multi-wallet management.<br>**Developer-Friendly:** Provides a robust set of tools for managing user sessions and permissions. | ✔️ **Recommended.** Use Dynamic.xyz for its powerful wallet connection and user authentication capabilities, and integrate our library to handle the full lifecycle of transactions initiated through it. |
| **[Web3Onboard](https://web3onboard.thirdweb.com/)** | ✔️ **Yes.** Offers real-time transaction notifications. | ❌ **No.** Does not explicitly offer a manageable transaction pool. | **Framework-Agnostic:** Compatible with most modern JavaScript frameworks.<br>**Extensive Wallet Support:** Supports over 35 hardware and software wallets.<br>**Multi-Chain Ready:** Designed for easy network switching. | ✔️ **Recommended.** Web3Onboard can manage wallet connections and provide initial notifications, while our library can offer a more in-depth tracking experience, history, and advanced state management. |
| **[RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/)** | ✔️ **Yes.** Features a "Recent Transactions" list, but transactions must be manually registered and are stored in local storage. | ❌ **No.** Lacks a centralized transaction pool; relies on local storage. | **Excellent UI/UX:** Delivers a polished and intuitive user experience for connecting wallets.<br>**Seamless `wagmi` Integration:** Works perfectly with the `wagmi` React Hooks for Ethereum. | ✔️ **Recommended.** Leverage RainbowKit for its best-in-class connection modals and UI, and use our library to provide a more robust and persistent transaction tracking system in the background. |
| **[ConnectKit](https://family.co/docs/connectkit)** | ✔️ **Yes.** Provides UI for transaction activity and options to speed up or cancel transactions. | ❌ **No.** No explicit information on a developer-accessible transaction pool. | **Simple & Clean UX:** Focuses on providing a simple, attractive, and straightforward user experience.<br>**Themable:** Offers customization options to match your dApp's branding. | ✔️ **Recommended.** Similar to RainbowKit, use ConnectKit for its elegant wallet connection UI and integrate our library to manage the underlying transaction states and notifications. |
| **[Web3Auth](https://web3auth.io/)** | ❌ **No.** The primary focus is on authentication and non-custodial key management, not post-authentication transaction tracking. | ❌ **No.** | **Seamless Onboarding:** Enables users to log in with familiar Web2 methods (social accounts, email) without needing to understand complex crypto concepts initially.<br>**Non-Custodial:** Users retain full control over their keys via MPC. | ✔️ **Recommended.** Web3Auth is an excellent choice for user onboarding. Our library can be integrated to manage all blockchain interactions and transactions after the user is authenticated and starts using the dApp. |
