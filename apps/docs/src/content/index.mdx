# Introduction

<VideoPreview />

Welcome to the documentation for the **TUWA Web3 Transaction Tracking Suite** 🚀 - your complete solution for creating world-class transaction experiences in Web3 applications.

## The Challenge

Building great Web3 user experiences goes far beyond just submitting transactions to the blockchain. Modern dApp users expect:

- **Real-time updates** on their transaction status
- **Clear visual feedback** from pending to confirmation
- **Error handling** with actionable retry options
- **Multi-chain support** across different networks
- **Beautiful interfaces** that don't feel like developer tools

Manually building this tracking infrastructure is complex, time-consuming, and takes you away from building your core product features. Different wallet types, transaction replacements, network congestion, and cross-chain operations create a maze of edge cases that are painful to handle correctly.

## Our Solution: Complete Transaction UX

The TUWA suite transforms transaction tracking from a complex technical challenge into a simple integration. We provide everything you need to deliver a seamless, professional transaction experience with just a few lines of code.

### 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

Our modular approach gives you flexibility while maintaining simplicity:
