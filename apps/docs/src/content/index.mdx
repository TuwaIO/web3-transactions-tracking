# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the **TUWA Web3 Transaction Tracking Suite**. This collection of packages offers a powerful, end-to-end solution designed to dramatically simplify and automate real-time transaction monitoring in your dApp.

### The Challenge

Developing a robust decentralized application involves more than just submitting transactions to the blockchain. Users expect a smooth, informative experience where they can see the status of their actions in real timeâ€”from the moment a transaction is sent, to its confirmation, and even if it fails or gets replaced. Manually building this tracking logic is a complex and repetitive task that distracts from building the core features of your product.

### Our Solution: A Complete Toolkit

The TUWA suite handles the entire lifecycle of transaction tracking for you. By providing a modular, headless core and a beautiful, pre-built UI, we empower you to deliver a seamless user experience with minimal setup. Our goal is to manage the complexities of on-chain activity so you can focus on what matters most: your application's unique value proposition.

### Key Features

* **Headless Core Engine:** The system is built around a central `@tuwa/web3-transactions-tracking-core` package, which provides shared TypeScript types and a Zustand-based store for a global, persistent transaction history.

* **Comprehensive EVM Support:** The `@tuwa/evm-transactions-tracking` package offers robust support for all EVM-compatible chains. It intelligently detects the transaction type and uses the appropriate tracker.

* **Multi-Platform Tracking:** Out-of-the-box support for:
  * Standard on-chain transactions (via hash).
  * Meta-transactions through **Gelato Network** (via Task ID).
  * Multi-signature operations with **Safe** (via SafeTxHash).

* **Beautiful Pre-built UI:** The `@tuwa/transactions-tracking-ui` package provides a suite of polished React components, including automated toasts and modals, styled with Tailwind CSS for a beautiful user experience right out of the box.

* **Highly Customizable:** Use our UI components as-is or provide your own custom components to match your dApp's branding. The entire UI is themeable and supports light/dark modes.

* **Wallet Agnostic:** Our trackers are unopinionated about wallet connections and integrate seamlessly with any setup built on `wagmi`, including popular solutions like **RainbowKit** and **ConnectKit**.

### Who Is This For?

This project is for any developer or team building a web3 application that needs a reliable, easy-to-integrate, and scalable system for tracking on-chain transactions. If you're tired of writing boilerplate code for transaction monitoring, this is the solution for you.
